* start on mockups (figma, sketch, etc)
* don't code them yet

name: Hierarchy

* visual hierarchy
* what users see first, order of gaze
* visual saliency

.fancy.medium[[![fpatttern](img/fpattern2.jpeg)](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394)]


???

* When laying out your page, remember to think about the visual hierarchy
* What will users eyes see first, your call to action, or the large user profile button that they never really need to go to
* Try to imagine what you would notice first as a new user and then order your elements in terms of visual saliency appropriately
* Larger and brighter colored things tend to be noticed first
* Positioning also matters, we tend to look at things in a [letter F pattern](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394).

???
* famous designer
* every choice you make conveys something
* you chose blue for a restaurant site because you like blue
* but blue is not appetizing, doesn't make people feel hungry - RED does weird.
* think about and defend every choice you make - 'i just like it' doesn't cut it.
