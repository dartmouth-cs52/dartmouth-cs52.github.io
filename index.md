# Course Overview

The Web is a powerful delivery tool for complex real-time applications. This is a new hands-on course that will introduce the state of the art of full-stack web development. You will learn to build not only interactive web applications, but also chatbots, and mobile apps. This class will be an adventure and requires active participation both inside and outside of class. There will be lab projects, exercises in class, and a collaborative final project.

By the end of term, you will:

* use your knowledge of the fundamental concepts and best practices of web application development to design web systems from the ground up
* utilize state of the art tools and frameworks used to build web technologies
* build your own web applications with front-end UIs and server-side APIs

Topics include: static pages, Internet protocols, layout, markup, event-driven asynchronous programming, deployment, security, scalability, and user experience.

Prerequisites: CS10 or permission of [instructor](mailto:tim@cs.dartmouth.edu)

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to the course?  There are several opportunites:

*  Want to file a bug report?  All the presentations, and assignments on this website are on [github](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/dartmouth-cs52.github.io).
* Want to pass on your knowledge, and help the next generation of webdevs? Future TA's <a href="http://cs52.me/ta/" target="_blank">apply here!</a>.  You don't really know something until you've tried explaining it to others. [Ask me](https://cs52-dartmouth.slack.com/messages/@tim/) about the opportunity if you want to learn more. 
* Want to build cool interactive webdev learning games like [boomsync](http://boomsync.me)? There's some funding available to help with that, [slack me about it](https://cs52-dartmouth.slack.com/messages/@tim/).
