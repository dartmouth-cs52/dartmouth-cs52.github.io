# Memur #

![](img/projects_18s/memur-logo.png){: .tiny }

> Memur is an anonymous, community meme-sharing platform. Users can post and scroll through memes posted by members within a 5 mile radius and react to memes by up-voting or down-voting. The main feed can be sorted by "Dank" memes, or the most popular memes ranked by up-votes, or my most recent. A user can also upload their own memes to the feed for area and view his or her personal meme statistics and rankings.

# RealTalk #

> RealTalk is a space for prospective and current students of Dartmouth to ask questions and get real answers from current students. We believe that this website will be particularly helpful for prospective and new students with little prior connection to Dartmouth who come from areas where Dartmouth-related resources may be scarce (e.g. parts of Iowa). User-authentication will not be required to view the question and answers, but a user will need to sign in/up to post new content or edit existing content. Users will only be able to edit their own content, though they can up-vote or down-vote other people's content.

# @now #

> @Now is a web app that allows Dartmouth students to create short job offerings and have other students take the offers at that moment. This can be used for anything from looking for someone to stand in the kaf line or trying to get a student to tutor you and help with some homework.

# Blip #

>The best feature of social media platforms is sharing and saving moments from your life - but there is increasing pressure to make that life seem perfect to impress the people who follow you. Blip is different. No followers. No likes. Just friends and fun things your friends want you to see. The core functionality is a camera that allows people to combine multiple short videos into a compilation, and a feed to view the clips your friends have shared.
