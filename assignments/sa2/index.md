### To Turn In

1. URL to your added html page at http://cs52.me/16X-git-map/people/[yourname.html]
1. URLs to your successfully closed pull requests (you can find your pull requests [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/16X-git-map/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)). Its ok and normal to have several of these, you don't have to have gotten it right the first time. Requirements:
  * your github username and email are correctly set
  * you made a branch and did a pull request that was successfully merged into dartmouth-cs52/16X-git-map:gh-pages
  * your face marker appears on the main page:  http://cs52.me/16X-git-map
  * and your marker is clickable and shows your people page
1. A short answer response to:
  * How comfortable do you feel you are with git after this assignment/workshop?
  * Is there anything about git flow you'd like covered in more detail?

### Extra Credit

* Make your page more interesting than mine.
* Add in some CSS even though we haven't talked about it yet.
* Make a pull request to fix any bugs in the workshop README.md, leave these open so we can see them.
