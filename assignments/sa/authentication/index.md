For this assignment we are going to build an [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) CRUD api server for our react+redux blog frontend. This will finally bring our stack all the way down to the database. In this part we're going to be adding in Authentication!

## Assignment At a Glance

  * Authentication: We'll extend both our frontend and our backend to support authentication and users!

On the frontend we'll want to add a place for users to sign in.  We'll create a `/signin`, `/signup`, and `/signout` routes and add a way to restrict access to certain routes based on authentication.   We'll do this by designing our own higher order component, similarly to how the redux `connect` method works.

On the api server,  we're going to also add `/signin` and `/signup` routes that will connect to a new User model and Controller.  We will also use [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) to make JWT's for us.  


## Some Setup

We'll just continue working on the same code from Lab5 part1.

We're going to do a new thing with our git repos. We're going to `tag` a certain revision so you'll know where you started on part 2.

üöÄ Go into your Lab5 directory and run:

```bash
git tag beforeAuth
git push origin --tags
```

üöÄ Go into your Lab4 directory and run:

```bash
git tag beforeAuth
git push origin --tags
```

Great, now you can always remember where you veered off course and made this terrible decision to add authentication to your lovely content platform.

You will end up with 3 server urls at the end of this: A .netlify.app url for loading the frontend, a .herokuapp.com for the api server, and an Atlas Cloud Mongo database url.  

We'll be working on both the api server and frontend app.

## Secret Key

For signing our JWT's on the **server side** we'll need a secret key.  Might as well set that up now.

We'll need to create an `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with some long random string (any characters).

Use the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) module to import it into your code. IE. Save `AUTH_SECRET="somerandomstringthiscanbeanythingyoushouldmakeityourown"` into a `.env` file that you do not add to git.

üöÄ Add .env to your .gitignore file.

Then in your code in any file where you need the secret you can use:

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config({ silent: true });

// and then the secret is usable this way:
process.env.AUTH_SECRET
```

‚ö†Ô∏è During deployment for Heroku you'll need to add `AUTH_SECRET` to your config variables in Settings!

![](img/heroku.jpg){: .medium .fancy }

## API Server Auth support

Let's start adding authentication support to the api server.

### User Model

To start with, we want to add Users. This means we'll need a User model.

üöÄ You know models from P1, oh yes you do.  Create a `models/user_model.js` file.  It will be set up identically to your Post model (ie. copy and refactor), but with the following fields:

```javascript
email: { type: String, unique: true, lowercase: true },
password: { type: String }
```  

For now we won't store anything else in the User model, but you may eventually want to add to this.

Make sure you have the config object: 

```javascript
{
  toObject: { virtuals: true },
  toJSON: { virtuals: true },
  timestamps: true,
}
```

These various settings provide a cleaner output object to JSON with `id` from `_id`, and also turns on using timestamps for each record.

####  Salt + Hash

Remember how we planned on saving our passwords?

![](img/saving_password.png){: .medium .fancy }

Now we get to implement that!

üöÄ We're going to use the [`bcryptjs`](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) module for this. So you should `npm install bcryptjs` now and import it.

#### Saving Salt+Hash

For saving the password,  we're going to need a utilize a mongoose [pre save hook](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html#pre). This is a bit tricky.   We define a function that will be called when the User object is saved.  It will then take the plain text password and generate a salt and hash the password and save the salt+hash instead.

The general syntax for the pre-save hook is:

```javascript
yourModelSchema.pre('save', async function beforeyYourModelSave(next) {

  // this is a reference to our model
  // the function runs in some other context so DO NOT bind it
  const model = this;


  //TODO: do stuff here

  // when done run the **next** callback with no arguments
  // call next with an error if you encounter one
  // return next();

});
```

For the [`bcryptjs`](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) part what we'll want to do first is generate a salt and then use that salt to hash our password.  Take a look at the docs, there's a few ways to do it. `10` (the default) is fine for the number of rounds.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Try doing this yourself following the docs but here's the whole of it for "reference" in await/async notation.
</summary>

```js
// On Save Hook, encrypt password
// Before saving a model, run this function
//  note use of named function rather than arrow notation
//  arrow notation is lexically scoped and prevents binding scope, which would prevent us from using the correct this
UserSchema.pre('save', async function beforeUserSave(next) {
  // get access to the user model
  const user = this;

  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();

  try {
    // salt, hash, then set password to hash
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    const hash = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt);
    user.password = hash;
    return next();
  } catch (error) {
    return next(error);
  }
});
```

</details>

üöÄ construct a method for:  `userSchema.pre('save', function beforeUserSave(next) {`.  Don't forget that you'll need to set `user` to `this` at the top.

üöÄ Generate a salt as they do in the docs and then hash `user.password` with the salt. Tip: in the docs the first argument to hash is the password, in our case you have it in a variable `user.password` - in case that was confusing documentation.

üöÄ Set the `user.password` to the hash and `return next()` which will allow the hook to proceed.

But wait, won't this update every single time we save the user?  Yes, that might not be ideal if later we want to add in new fields and such!

Luckily, you can add a check to see if the  `password` field is being updated or not at the top:

```javascript
  // only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new)
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
```
Great, now we've got the first part down, how about comparing.

#### Comparing Salt+Hash

We now want to add a method to our model to support comparing passwords.  Turns out there is a nice way to [add methods to a schema](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) in Mongoose. As with anything javascript, everything is just an object, so we can add a property in at anytime.

üöÄ We need to add a method that takes a `candidatePassword` and returns a boolean.  We'll use the `bcrypt.compare` functionality to do this.  We'll make this an async function.

```javascript
// note use of named function rather than arrow notation
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function comparePassword(candidatePassword) {
  const comparison = await bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);
  return comparison;
};
```

This is slightly adapted for es6 from stackoverflow [mongoose-password-hashing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14588032/mongoose-password-hashing).


### User Controller

Let's add an new User controller!  

üöÄ Create a `controllers/user_controller.js`.

To encode and decode our JWT's we're going to use the [`jwt-simple`](https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple). Go ahead and npm install it and import it: `import jwt from 'jwt-simple';`

üöÄ Also import our new User model and init `dotenv` same as you did before!

The controller has functions that we call for express routes. We are going to add 2 new routes `/signin` and `/signup`, so lets create function headers for those:


```javascript

export const signin = (user) => {
}

//note the lovely destructuring here indicating that we are passing in an object with these 3 keys
export const signup = async ({ email, password }) => {
}
```

When we generate a new JWT we need to simply encode a particular bit of json.  This json has particular recommended fields which we'll use. We'll use `sub` or subject claim for the *user id* and `iat` for the *issued at timestamp*. This is according to the [JWT standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2). 

üöÄ We'll just create a helper function for this:

```javascript
// encodes a new token for a user object
function tokenForUser(user) {
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  return jwt.encode({ sub: user.id, iat: timestamp }, process.env.AUTH_SECRET);
}
```

What should our two authentication methods do?

![](img/token_process.png){: .small .fancy }

For `signin`, once we have verified username/password we can just generate a new token. We're going to do the verification with a passport middleware, so our `signin` function will already be protected -- all it has to do is return a new token, nice and simple.

```javascript
return tokenForUser(user);
```

For `signup`, it will be a bit more complicated. We need to create a new User object and save it, but first we need to verify that the user doesn't already exist in the system (check their email address).

First, let's grab email and password and check them (this is inside the `signup` function):

```javascript
if (!email || !password) {
  throw new Error('You must provide email and password');
}

// See if a user with the given email exists
const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
if (existingUser) {
  // If a user with email does exist, return an error
  throw new Error('Email is in use');
}


// üöÄ TODO:
// here you should use the User model to create a new user.
// this is similar to how you created a Post
// and then save and return a token
await user.save();
return tokenForUser(user);

```

Ok, now we have our controller and model done.  We need one more module. A module that will provide passport authentication services to the rest of the app.

### Passport Service

![](img/passport-logo.png){: .tiny .fancy }


We're going to use more npm modules! Yay!

```bash
npm install passport passport-local passport-jwt
```

We'll be using [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) to provide authentication services.  Passport gives us multiple authentication "strategies".  We'll use `passport-local` for authenticating with username and password, and `passport-jwt` for using JWT's. 

Passport is a middleware in our routes, and it will analyze requests that need to be protected and deal with validating our JWT. It will do this automatically as a middleware on our routes.

![](img/passport_strategies.png){: .small .fancy }


üöÄ Create a directory and file: `services/passport.js`.

```javascript
import passport from 'passport';
import LocalStrategy from 'passport-local';
import { Strategy as JwtStrategy, ExtractJwt } from 'passport-jwt';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

import User from '../models/user_model';

// loads in .env file if needed
dotenv.config({ silent: true });

// options for local strategy, we'll use email AS the username
// not have separate ones
const localOptions = { usernameField: 'email' };

// options for jwt strategy
// we'll pass in the jwt in an `authorization` header
// so passport can find it there
const jwtOptions = {
  jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromHeader('authorization'),
  secretOrKey: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
};
// NOTE: we are not calling this a bearer token (although it technically is), if you see people use Bearer in front of token on the internet you could either ignore it, use it but then you have to parse it out here as well as prepend it on the frontend.


// username/email + password authentication strategy
const localLogin = new LocalStrategy(localOptions, async (email, password, done) => {
  //should find user by email and check password
});

const jwtLogin = new JwtStrategy(jwtOptions, async (payload, done) => {
  //is called with confirmed jwt we just need to confirm that user exits
});

// Tell passport to use this strategy
passport.use(jwtLogin); // for 'jwt'
passport.use(localLogin); // for 'local'

// middleware functions to use in routes
export const requireAuth = passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false });
export const requireSignin = passport.authenticate('local', { session: false });
```

For `localLogin` we need to run the `comparePassword` function that we wrote earlier. 


<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Here's the `localLogin` function in the interest of time:
</summary>

```javascript
const localLogin = new LocalStrategy(localOptions, async (email, password, done) => {
  let user;
  let isMatch;

  try {
    user = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (!user) {
      return done(null, false);
    }
    isMatch = await user.comparePassword(password);
    if (!isMatch) {
      return done(null, false);
    } else {
      return done(null, user);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return done(error);
  }
});
```

Read through the above, make sense? 

‚úçÔ∏è Comment each of the `done` calls above to explain what case it is and what it is doing.

</details>


For `jwtLogin`, we are given the payload of the passed in JWT. We need to check the userid and return the found user.  

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Want to give this one a shot?
</summary>

```javascript
const jwtLogin = new JwtStrategy(jwtOptions, async (payload, done) => {
  let user;
  try {
    user = await User.findById(payload.sub);
  } catch (error) {
    done(error, false);
  }
  if (user) {
    done(null, user);
  } else {
    done(null, false);
  }
});
```

‚úçÔ∏è Don't forget to comment above each done to indicate what it is doing.

</details>

‚ö†Ô∏è Many mongoose functions return a null object rather than an error ‚Äî hence we have to check that. `done` is the callback and has the form `done(error, value)` as is fairly common with some JS libraries.

How does this all fit together?

### Authentication Routes

Now that we have all the required parts, we are ready to tie it all together with Routes!  

üöÄ Edit your `router.js` file:

```javascript
// our imports as usual
import * as UserController from './controllers/user_controller';
import { requireAuth, requireSignin } from './services/passport';
```

üöÄ Let's add in the `/signin` route.  Note the `requireSignin`. This is the passport middleware. It makes this route protected by the password+username strategy we defined in our passport.js file. Only once the user is authenticated via that method, will it allow the `UserController.signin` function to run.

```javascript
router.post('/signin', requireSignin, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const token = UserController.signin(req.user);
    res.json({ token, email: req.user.email });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(422).send({ error: error.toString() });
  }
});
```

üöÄ And add in the `/signup` route.

```javascript
router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const token = await UserController.signup(req.body);
    res.json({ token, email: req.body.email });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(422).send({ error: error.toString() });
  }
});
```

üëÄ See how we are handling the `req` and `res` objects in each router function.  This will be the pattern that we use, await an async function in the controller then `res.json` to send the responce back to the client. 

Note also how we set a status code and then send an error message. Note the 422 is a status code, there are [lots of different status codes](https://http.cat/) to choose from, but is usually up to your client to interpret anyway, so choosing is somewhat arbitrary.

Both of these are POSTs, so that implies that we are hoping that the frontend is going to be passing in some data in the request body ‚Äî and that they match the email and password we are expecting.

üöÄ What other routes should be we protect?  For now let's use `requireAuth` to protect `createPost`, `updatePost`, and `deletePost`. As easy as:  `.post(requireAuth,async (req,res) => {})`

Try a `curl`  post to create a new post, you should get an unauthorized error!

Let's get a JWT we could use:

```bash

# try to signup
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "test@test.com","password": "password"}' "http://localhost:9090/api/signup"

# then try to signin
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "test@test.com","password": "password"}' "http://localhost:9090/api/signin"

# try posting!
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "authorization: JUST_THE_LONG_TOKEN_STRING" -d '{"title": "test","tags": "sometag","content": "this is a test post"}' "http://localhost:9090/api/posts"

```

Done!  You now have an API server that supports authentication. This is fairly rudimentary, but you can expand on this. For instance you can make sure that a user can only update their own posts (just save the userID along with the post).  

üÜí Within `post_controller.js` for any route that is protected by `requireAuth` you will now have a `req.user` object.  Nice!

üöÄ Might as well just add in recording who the author is with each post now.  Edit your `post_model.js` file and add in this field to your schema:  `author: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },`.  We are saying that the author field is now a reference to a User.   We can later get this value automatically filled for us or can use the id to look up the author using [`populate`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html).

üöÄ Don't forget to update your controller to utilize this new field.

Now when you make new posts, here's what your mongo database entry will look like:

```javascript
{ "_id" : ObjectId("57a94e206ec5eae238e359f8"), "author" : ObjectId("57a94813e4c55bb432fc3a4d"), "content" : "this is a test post", "tags" : "words", "title" : "first post MORE TESTING", "__v" : 0 }
```

You can also have arrays of objectIds.  This might come in handy if you are trying to model other types of relationships.

##  Frontend Authentication

Ok,  so now we should update our frontend to support authentication too right?  YES!

### Frontend Auth Summary

1. Add in new authentication actions and reducer
1. Add in `/signin`, and `/signup` routes
  * these routes will need associated components
1. Modify NavBar with links and signout functionality
1. Create a new higher order component to allow us to require auth on any frontend components

### Actions

![](img/auth_flow_frontend.png){: .medium .fancy }


üöÄ Add in 3 new action types:

```javascript
AUTH_USER: 'AUTH_USER',
DEAUTH_USER: 'DEAUTH_USER',
AUTH_ERROR: 'AUTH_ERROR',
```

We'll need 4 ActionCreators in your `actions/index.js` file.

```javascript

export function signinUser({ email, password }, history) {
  // takes in an object with email and password (minimal user object)
  // returns a thunk method that takes dispatch as an argument (just like our create post method really)
  // does an axios.post on the /signin endpoint
  // on success does:
  //  dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.AUTH_USER });
  //  localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);
  // on error should dispatch(authError(`Sign In Failed: ${error.response.data}`));
}



export function signupUser({ email, password }, history) {
  // takes in an object with email and password (minimal user object)
  // returns a thunk method that takes dispatch as an argument (just like our create post method really)
  // does an axios.post on the /signup endpoint (only difference from above)
  // on success does:
  //  dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.AUTH_USER });
  //  localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);
  // on error should dispatch(authError(`Sign Up Failed: ${error.response.data}`));
}


// deletes token from localstorage
// and deauths
export function signoutUser(history) {
  return (dispatch) => {
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.DEAUTH_USER });
    history.push('/');
  };
}

// trigger to deauth if there is error
// can also use in your error reducer if you have one to display an error message
export function authError(error) {
  return {
    type: ActionTypes.AUTH_ERROR,
    message: error,
  };
}

```

Most important difference in the above `signupUser` and `signinUser` ActionCreators is that they take the token that is in the response and put it in `localStorage`.  We'll be able to access this whenever we load up our site, so we'll remain logged in without having to re-authenticate every time.

### Authorization Header

We'll need to add an Authorization Header to some of the existing axios API calls. For each of `deletePost`, `createPost`, `updatePost` you'll need to modify the axios call to pass in headers.  Here's what the `createPost` one will look like:

```javascript
axios.post(`${ROOT_URL}/posts`, post, { headers: { authorization: localStorage.getItem('token') } })
```

Note, the headers are in a config object being passed in as a third argument to axios.

### On First Load

üöÄ In your main `index.js` file you should add a check for token if you want it loaded on first start or reload:

```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
if (token) {
  store.dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.AUTH_USER });
}
```

This will set our state as authenticated if there is a token available that was previously saved.  You can debug this in your *Application* -> *Local Storage* Chrome inspector tab. 


### Reducer

üöÄ Create a new reducer `reducers/auth-reducer.js`.  Add it into your `reducers/index.js` with the key `auth`.  

Your reducer should for now have the default state of `{ authenticated: false }`.  Which means your state to access for if someone is authenticated is simply `state.auth.authenticated`.  We're making this a dictionary now because you might want to add more things, such as the user object here later.

Given the three actions we might get:

* AUTH_USER:  authenticated: true
* DEAUTH_USER:  authenticated: false
* AUTH_ERROR: authenticated: false


Why are we just setting a boolean you ask?  Good question. You may want to store something else, like the authorname which is a bit more useful.

The security here is provided by the server, which if you don't have a valid token won't allow you to do certain operations. The frontend just needs to know whether it has a valid token or not so a boolean will suffice here.

### Components

Ok, finally we're ready for the `SignIn` and `SignUp` components.

* **SignIn** ‚Äî A Redux connected component that has access to the `signinUser` ActionCreator.  Simple form with username and password.
* **SignUp** ‚Äî A Redux connected component that has access to the `signupUser` ActionCreator.  Simple form with whatever fields you want a user to have.


üöÄ Create these components. You can base them off of your New component pretty easily. Feel free to create one single component for this with different buttons triggering the signup / signin if you prefer that UX.

üöÄ Add Routes to these components in your `routes.js` file.


### NavBar

For SignOut simply make NavBar a connected component that has access to the `signoutUser` ActionCreator.  That ActionCreator can do a `history.push` to '/' on signout. You can just have a signout button that triggers this ActionCreator. Then `mapStateToProps` and use the `state.auth.authenticated` to only show the signout button if a user is logged in, and signup/signout otherwise.

Additionally add Links to `/signin` and `/signup`.


### Authorized Component

One last thing.  Right now an unauthenticated user can access the Add a post functionality. They will get an error (if you implemented an error action+reducer+component) or just a submit button that doesn't work.  Let's make that page protected so that if the user isn't authenticated they will be prompted to log in. Rather than adding checks into each of our components, we are going higher order component that wraps Route!  How might you go about doing this?

What we can do is create a new component that wraps a Route component and some logic inside it. 

üöÄ Create a new component `privateRoute.js`.

We'll make it a function based component, but also connected to redux, because why not.

Here's a start:

```js 
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { withRouter, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';

// Router Wrapper
const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Child, ...props }) => {
// some stuff goes here

}

export default withRouter(connect(mapStateToProps, null)(PrivateRoute));
```

Wait, what is the `{ component: Child, ...props }` destructuring assignment doing?  We're pulling out props.component and renaming it to Child, and then naming the rest of the argument props. Cool huh?


üöÄ Create the `mapStateToProps` function and map `authenticated` to `reduxState.auth.authenticated`. We won't need any actions inside this component so disregard `mapDispatchToProps` and keep that null.

Now, we'll render a Route component and using [React Router render and Redirect](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/auth-workflow) to insert a ternary conditional rendering based on whether `props.authenticated` is true or false.

üöÄ Return: 
```js
    <Route
      {...props}
      render={(routeProps) => (props.authenticated ? (
        <Child {...routeProps} />
      ) : (
        <Redirect to="/signin" />
      ))}
    />
```

Done! Now in your `routes.js` you can import `PrivateRoute` and protect the `New` path like so:
`<PrivateRoute path="/posts/new" component={New} />`

## Lastly

üöÄ Extend the User Model to store the author's name in addition to email, and add in support for that everywhere.  

üöÄ Display the Author Name along with every post. You are welcome to either duplicate the name and store it directly as a field in the Post model, or look it up by reference.  Note: `name` is a reserved word in JS and can cause problems if you reassign object.name, so call your field something other than name.

üçπThe best time/place to have access to the User object is actually right when you create the post on the api side.  Since that route is an authenticated route, passport adds the user object to the request for you!  In your createPost method in your post controller you would have access to: `req.user`.  If the user object has say an `authorname` field, then that would be available there for you to then save along with the post.

There are 2 ways to associate the user with the post.  You can save a `ref` to the whole user object (which you started to set up when you added author as an ObjectID type field). If you do that, then later when you retrieve the user you need to use [`populate`](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) to fill in the object. Or you could add a `authorname` field to post and assign that.  Using a reference and populating on retrieval is the better way,  you can even select which field specifically to populate so you aren't sending the whole user object if you don't want to.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
üöÄ You may have noticed that password may be returned along with the entire user object. If that is the case you may change your User Scheme <code>toJSON</code> options to be include a transform that cleans up the user object a little bit when converted to json.
</summary>

```js
  toJSON: {
    virtuals: true,
    transform(doc, ret, options) {
      ret.id = ret._id;
      delete ret._id;

## P2 Complete

Test it all out and make sure all the parts still work!

Commit, tag both your Lab5 and Lab4 repos with `v2`, and push your tags! Deploy everything. At this point you don't need any help with that.


## To Turn In

1. github url to your repo
1. url to your heroku app instance for testing
1. netlify url for your content platform app that uses your new API server and has authentication!
1. your app should:
  * have users sign-in, sign-up, sign-out
  * not allow people to access /posts/new when not logged in
  * have a user model that stores authorname, salt+hashed password, and name
1. your repos should include a README.md file with:
  * a couple sentence description about what you did
  * and what worked / didn‚Äôt work
  * any extra credit attempted


## Extra Credit
*always mention your extra credit in the README.md file*

* so you now have users, what can you do with users? so many things!
* if you didn't add error message handling before you should do it now (error state in store, error reducer, error action, error component)
* add more pages and content to your app, how about a profile page for each user (add in /user frontend route and api endpoints)
* extend the permissions system so that users can only edit their own posts
* add a live preview to the main content editing (a parallel view that renders the markdown as you edit it).
* add in commenting system, authenticated users can comment on posts
* add search functionality (advanced, [tips](https://www.compose.com/articles/full-text-search-with-mongodb-and-node-js/))
* add images to posts (advanced, [s3](/assignments/sa/s3-upload/))
* add auto-complete to tags (advanced, store tags separately, query tags api endpoint as you type)
* suggest other, this is your time to make this your own.
